This project was done for the University of Pennsylvania Data Analytics Bootcamp using Python and the libraries Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib working in a Jupyter Notebook. The purpose of this project was to explore the use of unsupervised machine learning, specifically k-Means, to cluster cryptocurrencies found in a given dataset. First, the data was cleaned and processed to make it usable to for unsupervised learning. This step included tasks like dropping rows with null values, dropping columns not useful for unsupervised learning, and using Get Dummies to convert categorical data to numeric. Due to the use of Get Dummies, it was also necessary to engage in dimensionality reduction first with PCA and then with t-SNE. Next, once the data was prepared it could be plotted as a preview. Then, a for loop provided insight into the best k value to use with k-Means clustering and an elbow curve illustrated this. Finally, the best k value was used with the k-Means unsupervised learning model to cluster the cryptocurrency data; a plot of this data revealed that while clustering is possible, other insights would be necessary to offer any meaningful recommendations regarding the desirability of investment in a given cryptocurrency.
